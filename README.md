Self-driving vehicles are cars or trucks in which human drivers are never required to take
control to safely operate the vehicle. Also known as autonomous or “driverless” cars,
they combine sensors and software to control, navigate, and drive the vehicle. 
The project presents a mobile robot which is designed to autonomously navigate through a track by
detecting lanes and centering itself between them by using a camera. We are proposing a
basic and simplest algorithm for tracking and detecting lanes considering cameras'
parameters. This project uses Machine Learning (Convolutional Neural Networks) and
OpenCV library for digital image processing under LINUX environment.
